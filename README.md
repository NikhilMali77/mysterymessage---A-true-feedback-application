# 📩 MysteryMessage - Anonymous feedback application

MysteryMessage is a fun and anonymous messaging web application built with **Next.js**. The main idea is to let users create unique message links that others can open to read secret messages — anonymously and privately. This was created as part of a learning journey to master **Next.js** and understand key concepts like SSR, API routes, dynamic routing, and deployment.
